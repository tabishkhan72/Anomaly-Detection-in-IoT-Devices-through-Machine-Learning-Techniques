# **Anomaly Detection in IoT Devices through Machine Learning Techniques**  

## **üìå Overview**  
This project aims to **enhance anomaly detection in Internet of Things (IoT) devices** using **advanced machine learning (ML) techniques**. Traditional **rule-based anomaly detection methods** struggle to handle the **large-scale, dynamic, and complex** data generated by IoT devices. Machine learning algorithms provide a more **adaptive and scalable** solution by learning **patterns and anomalies** from data over time.  

However, **accuracy and efficiency** remain key challenges. This project explores various **ML techniques**, including **deep learning, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and clustering methods**, to build and optimize **anomaly detection models** for IoT environments.
